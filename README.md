# PHP Code Obfuscation
This is simple and easy to use php obfuscator coded in PHP and specific designed for php files that use echo and print instead of closing and opening php yet in future will support for many things as i learn or get suggestions.

Goal is to make obfuscated code to function after it is obfuscated supporting multiple php files and mainly improving all as much as possible without affecting intended code functionality
